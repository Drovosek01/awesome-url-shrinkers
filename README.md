#### Special

They allow you to shorten a link only for links from certain services.

- https://got.by/

#### Earn money

The main page of the services states that they are made for making money. In other words, such services will not perform instant redirection, but will display ads during redirection.

### The service has been suspended

On the main page there is a notification that the service has been suspended for an unknown period.

- https://sc.link/


### Check with a VPN

The pages of these sites have not been opened in Russia. Perhaps these services simply do not work in Russia due to the implementation of sanctions against Russia, or perhaps these services have simply died. It is necessary to check the opening of these sites with the VPN enabled.
